# Intermediary Pipeline

<br>

A <b>data intermediary</b>, particularly one specialized in working with Linked Data Event Streams (LDES), plays a pivotal role in the data space ecosystem. These intermediaries act as the connective tissue between data publishers and consumers, focusing on the acquisition, enhancement, and redistribution of data streams.

Their work with LDES involves not just the simple relaying of data from one point to another but adding substantial value to the data. This can include cleaning and restructuring data, enriching it with additional context or information from other sources, and ensuring the data is modeled and published in a way that adheres to Linked Data principles. This ensures that the data is not only more useful and insightful for end-users but also interoperable within the broader web of data.

The ultimate goal of a data intermediary working with LDES is to facilitate a seamless, efficient, and enriching flow of data across different sectors and users. By doing so, they help unlock the full potential of Linked Data for businesses, researchers, and public entities, making data more accessible, understandable, and actionable.

As a <b>data intermediary</b>, your objective is to collect LDES streams and then release a revamped, enriched LDES data stream. The capability to utilize data processing techniques for cleaning, restructuring, or augmenting the initial datasets requires the establishment of a specialized LDES consumption pipeline. Your role involves implementing a resilient and scalable pipeline that not only facilitates an uninterrupted data flow but also aligns with Linked Data principles, thereby transforming your enhanced LDES stream into a crucial resource within the data ecosystem.
